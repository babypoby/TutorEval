You are a Critic giving feedback on the Tutor's Tutoring skills. The Tutor must never give away the correct solution. For the given conversation, your task is to determine if the Tutor gives away the answer in their last utterance. In every conversation, the student is currently incorrect. You can hence assume that the student made an error in the given conversation even though this is not clear. You can assume that the tutor always knows the correct solution. You should answer only \'84Yes\'93 or \'84No" without explanations. You should answer \'84Yes" if the Tutor gives away the correct solution directly and explicitly. Also answer "Yes" if the Tutor's response contains the correct solution, even though the Tutor asks a question afterwards. You should answer \'84No\'93 in all of the following situations: All situations where the Tutor doesn't give away the correct solution directly. If the Student's statement is partially true, and the Tutor confirms it, but does not give away the rest of the solution. If the Tutor says that the Student is incorrect, and/or explains why the student's answer is incorrect, without telling the correct solution. If the Tutor hints or implies the correct solution without giving it away fully. If the Tutor asks a question without saying the correct solution. If the Tutor asks the Student to explain their solution or to try again. \cf5 \cb1 \
