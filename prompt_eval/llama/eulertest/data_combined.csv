5000008_4,"TUTOR: hi can you talk me through your answer STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating how much Leah spent on the milkshake. I divided 28 by 7, which gave me 4, so she spent 4 dollars on the milkshake. Then I subtracted 4 from 28, which gave me 24. I then divided 24 by 2, which gave me 12. This was the amount she put in her savings account. I added 1 to 12, which gave me 13. This was the amount she had before her dog shredded her wallet. Finally, I subtracted 13 from 28, which gave me 15. This was the amount she lost. TUTOR: ok I can see you have calculated that Leah put 12 in her savings so she must also have put 12 in her wallet. If her dog shredded all the money apart from £1 how much did she lose",No,Yes,No,Yes
5000015_1,"TUTOR: Hi Ayisha, can you please guide me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure, I started by calculating the increase in weight. The cow's weight increased from 400 to 600 pounds, which is an increase of 200 pounds. Then I multiplied the weight increase by the price per pound to get the increase in value. 200 pounds x $3 per pound = $600. Finally, I added the increase in value to the original value of the cow, which was $1800. So the total value of the cow after gaining weight is $1800 + $600 = $2400. TUTOR: Okay, so can you please tell me why you multiplied 600 with $3?",No,Yes,No,Yes
5000028_3,"TUTOR: Hello Steven, please can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I used the first spray to kill 50% of the germs, leaving 50% remaining. Then I used the second spray to kill 25% of the remaining germs, leaving 75% of the original germs. However, since 5% of the germs were already killed by the first spray, I subtracted that from the remaining germs: 75% - 5% = 70%. So, using both sanitizer sprays together would leave 70% of the germs remaining. TUTOR: I have 10 counters. I colour 50% red and 30% green.What % have I coloured and how do you know?",No,Yes,No,Yes

5000050_2,"TUTOR: Hi Mariana can you talk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure. I figured that if Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks, then he uses up 1/14 of a pencil each day. Then I figured that if it takes him 1050 words to use up 1/14 of a pencil, then it takes him 1050 x 14 = 14700 words to use up a whole pencil. So I divided 14700 by 30, which is the number of days in two weeks, to get 490 words for each crossword puzzle on average. TUTOR: OK. looking at it per day is one way of doing this. But can you look again at the question again, it has already told you that it takes 1050 words to use up a pencil. You dont need to calculate this part. Can you look at your solution and see how this alters what you have said?",No,Yes,,Yes

5000057_1,"TUTOR: Hello Alejandra, please explain to me how you reached your answer. STUDENT: I started by adding the number of people who took wine and soda, which was 26 + 22 = 48. Then, I subtracted the 17 people who took both drinks to account for double-counting, which gave me 48 - 17 = 31. Finally, I added the 31 people who took only wine or only soda to the 17 people who took both drinks to get the total number of people at the gathering, which was 31 + 17 = 48. TUTOR: so if 26 people took wine and 22 people took soda. How many is that?",No,Yes,No,No
5000059_2,"TUTOR: I think we need to solve this backwards. How many did he have left? STUDENT: Yes, I see.

5000087_4,"TUTOR: Hello Mariana, please could you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the total distance that Carla needs to drive. I added 8 miles for the grocery store, 6 miles for picking up the kids from school, 12 miles for dropping them off at soccer practice, and then twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. This gave me a total of 38 miles. Then, I divided this by the car's fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, which gave me 1.52 gallons of gas. Finally, I multiplied this by the cost of gas per gallon, which was $2.50, and this gave me a total cost of $3.80. TUTOR: Can you tell me how far it is from school to soccer?",No,Yes,,
5000090_3,"TUTOR: Hello Luca, please can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the total amount Tonya spent on dolls for her younger sister, which was 4 x 15 = $60. Then I divided that by 2 to get the amount she could spend on her older sister, which was $30. Since each lego set cost $20, I divided 30 by 20 to get 1.5 sets. Since she can't buy half a set, I rounded up to 2 sets. TUTOR: You are correct about how much Tonya spent on her younger sister. Use this to check the 2nd part of your working.",No,Yes,No,Yes

She would have made $120 if she sold the water bottles at $2 each, but since she had to reduce the price to $1.85 each, she will only make $111. TUTOR: So how much extra money does she still need to buy the present after selling the bottles at the cheaper price?",No,Yes,No,
5000099_3,"TUTOR: Hi, do you want to tell me your solution? STUDENT: Yes, I think my answer is correct. I cut the pizza in half, giving me 2 x 40/2 = 40 slices. Then I cut these halves in half again, giving me 4 x 40/4 = 40 slices. So, I have 40 slices in total. If 1 slice falls off, then I have 40 - 1 = 39 slices left. I give Jelly one of the slices, so she gets 1 slice out of the 39 slices left. TUTOR: OK, some of your reasoning is correct but you seem a bit confused. Let's work through this step by step. Firstly, you seem to be confused by the difference between slices of pizza and slices of pepperoni. So let's start with the pizza. how many slices of pizza are there in total?",No,Yes,,Yes
5000111_1,"TUTOR: I feel you have made this more complicated than needed could you maybe find a simpler way STUDENT: Yes, I could have used the unit rate method to solve this problem.
Instead of finding the cost of one brown sock, I could have found the unit rate of the cost of a brown sock compared to a white sock.
The unit rate would be 25 cents for every white sock.
Therefore, 15 brown socks would cost 15 x 25 = 375 cents. TUTOR: How about firstly we start with the cost of two white socks and the difference between this and one brown sock",No,Yes,No,

I multiplied 40 centimeters by 20 centimeters to get 400 square centimeters. Since his two friends also built similar shaped houses, I assumed that their total area would also be 400 square centimeters. So, I added 400 + 400 to get 800 square centimeters as the total area of the triangular houses that Zion and his friends made. TUTOR: Ok I can see that you have correctly calculated the area of each house . How many friends also built a house",,Yes,No,
5000151_2,"TUTOR: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I started by figuring out the total number of people invited to the party. Ashley invited 20 friends, so the total number of people invited is 20 + 20 = 40. Then I figured out the number of people who actually attended the party. Half of the invited guests is 40/2 = 20, so each of the 20 guests who brought an additional person brought the total number of people to the party to 2 people. So the total number of people at the party is 20 + 20 + Ashley = 41. TUTOR: That doesn't seem to be correct. Can you tell how many friends did Ashely invite actually?",No,Yes,No,Yes

5000178_2,"TUTOR: Hi Scott, can you walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by letting x be the value of one gold coin. Then I said that Roman originally had 20/x gold coins. After that, I said he sold 3 gold coins for a total of 3x dollars. Then I said that after selling the 3 gold coins, he had 20 - 3x dollars. After that, I said that we know that 20 - 3x = 12. Then I solved for x, and got x = 2. So each gold coin is worth $2. Finally, I said that Roman originally had 20/2 = 10 gold coins. After selling 3 gold coins, he has 10 - 3 = 7 gold coins left. TUTOR: Wow. That seems like a lot! let's start from the beginning- if Dorothy paid $12 for 3 gold coins, how would we calculate what 1 gold coin is worth?",No,Yes,Yes,Yes

Then I realized that since Jame can tear 30 cards at a time, he needs to tear 990 cards / 30 cards per tear = 33 tears in total. After that, I figured out that if he tears cards 3 times a week, then he can tear 3 x 33 = 99 cards per week. Finally, I concluded that he can tear all 990 cards in 990 / 99 = 10 weeks. TUTOR: Okay, let's start from the beginning. How many cards can Jame tear in a week?",No,Yes,,Yes

Then, Sean has 4 dollars more than half of Fritz's money, so Sean has 20/2 + 4 = 14 dollars. Finally, Rick has three times as much money as Sean, so Rick has 3 x 14 = 42 dollars. Therefore, Rick and Sean have a total of 42 + 14 = 56 dollars. TUTOR: a good start. half of Fritz' mobney is $20. we know Sean has $4 more. how much does Sean have?",,Yes,Yes,
5000247_2,"TUTOR: Talk me through your solution? TUTOR: Talk me through your solution? STUDENT: I started by calculating the number of players who played in the first half. There were 11 players to start and 2 substitutions, so 11+2=13 players. Then, I knew that the team made twice as many substitutions in the second half, so I multiplied 2x2=4 to get the number of substitutions for the second half. That meant there were 13-2+4=15 players who played in the game. Finally, I subtracted 15 from 24 to get the number of players who did not play, which was 9.

5000717_3,"TUTOR: Hello Mariana, can you explain your solution to me? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the total number of books Carlos read in July and August, which was 28 + 30 = 58 books. Then I realized that he still needed to read 100 - 58 = 42 books to meet his goal. So I assumed that x was the number of books he read in June and set up the equation x + 58 = 100 - 42. After solving the equation, I got x = 0, which means Carlos did not need to read any books in June because he had already read enough books in July and August to meet his goal of 100 books for the summer. TUTOR: Look again at your equation.  Can you set it up as x = ....?",No,Yes,No,Yes
5000760_2,"TUTOR: Hi Jia, can you walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I started by calculating how much water each glass is missing. Each glass is missing 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of its capacity, so each glass has 6 x 1/5 = 1.2 ounces of water missing. Then I added up all the missing water from all 10 glasses, which is 1.2 x 10 = 12 ounces of water missing. Finally, I calculated how much water is needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim, which is 6 x 10 = 60 ounces of water. So, 60 - 12 = 48 ounces of water are needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim. TUTOR: Ahh I see, 48 ounces of water is a lot considering they are all 4/5 full. Can you look over your solution to try and see where you went wrong?",No,Yes,,

Next, I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons to get the number of spoons left. Finally, I set up an equation and solved for x, which was 4. So Julia bought a package of 4 spoons. TUTOR: Okay -  you've overcomplicated this. Let's start again. We know Julia has 12 spoons when setting the table. We also know she used three whilst sampling her stew. How many is that altogether?",No,Yes,No,
6000025_5,"TUTOR: Hi Cody, please have a look back at your answer and try again STUDENT: Okay, let's try again. Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought ""x"". Her husband bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons is now x + 5. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had 12 spoons left. We know that the total number of spoons is x + 5, so we can set up an equation: x + 5 = 12 Subtracting 5 from both sides: x = 7 So Julia bought a package of 7 spoons. 7 TUTOR: lets not think of the origional number being x as i think this is confusing you. what is the numbers we need to extract from the question",No,Yes,,Yes
6000044_4,"TUTOR: Ayisha, please tell me more about your solution in detail STUDENT: I started by looking at the opening bid of $200 and then added $50 each time for the subsequent bids. I then realized that there were 3 other people who each bid once, so I added up the bids to get to the final cost of $350. TUTOR: LEt's think a little harder. Starting bid was $200, then there were THREE bids. How much extra on the total would there be?",No,Yes,No,Yes
6000053_5,"TUTOR: Stephanie, can you break down your thinking for me STUDENT: Sure. I figured that the customer earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip, which is 80/20 = 4. Then I multiplied the 4 rewards by $1 to get $4 in rewards to use this shopping trip. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off, so I multiplied the $4 by 2 to get $8 off the price. The original price of the items was $43 + $4 = $47. After the coupon and rewards were applied, I subtracted the $8 from the $47 to get the customer's total of $39 TUTOR: Yes, the original price was $43. Where did you get the extra $4?",No,,,
6000060_1,"TUTOR: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the total interest she has to pay. I multiplied the amount borrowed ($3,650) by the interest rate (10%) and the number of months (5). This gave me a total interest of $1,825. Then, I added the total interest to the amount borrowed, which gave me a total amount of $5,475. Finally, I divided this total amount by the number of months (5) to get the amount she has to pay per month, which is $1,095. TUTOR: You seem to have misunderstood the question. The interest that Karan has to pay is not calculated for 5 months. It is fixed at the time of borrowing at 10%",,No,No,
6000069_1,"TUTOR: Hello Heidi, can you explain your method here please? STUDENT: Sure! I started by letting x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Then I figured out that he kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them, which is 2/3x. He sold them for $1.5 each, so he earned 1.5(2/3x) = 3x/2 dollars. He wanted to end up with $50 spending cash, so he needed to earn $100 + $50 = $150 in total. Therefore, 3x/2 = $150. Finally, I solved for x and got x = 100, so Kenny started with 100 cards. TUTOR: OK, good, you've made a great start!  You've got a little confused though, so let's try this another way. How much did Kenny make altogether when selling the cards?",No,Yes,Yes,Yes
