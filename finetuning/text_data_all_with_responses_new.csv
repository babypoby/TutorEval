The third ball is three times the size of the first ball, so it is 3x. She used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball, so x + 2x + 3x = 27. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 27. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 4.5. Therefore, the second ball is 2x = 2(4.5) = 9. So, Joy used 9 feet of yarn for the second ball. TUTOR: Okay, can you read the question again carefully. Is the figure given for the total yarn used or just for one of the balls?",No

I started by adding the number of trees that the company chopped down in the first and second half of the year, which was 200 + 300 = 500. Then I multiplied that number by 3 since the company wanted to plant three times the number of trees they chopped down. So I got 3 x 500 = 1500. Since the company only chopped down 500 trees, I subtracted 500 from 1500 to get 1000 trees that they need to plant. TUTOR: So, if the company has chopped down 500 trees, and they need to plant 3 times as many trees as they have chopped down, how many do they need to plant?",No
5000089_4,"TUTOR: why did you subtract 500 trees at the end? STUDENT: I subtracted 500 trees because I was trying to find out how many more trees the company needed to plant in order to be sustainable. Since they already chopped down 500 trees, they only need to plant an additional 1000 trees in order to reach their goal of planting three times the number of trees they chopped down.

5000102_5,"TUTOR: Hello Cody, please can you walk me through your workings? STUDENT: Sure, I started by looking at the ratio of the red candles to the blue candles, which was 5:3. That means for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles. So, I took the number of red candles (45) and divided it by the total number of candles (5+3) which gave me 5.625 sets of 5 red and 3 blue candles. To find the total number of blue candles, I multiplied the number of sets by the number of blue candles per set, which was 3. So, 5.625 x 3 = 16.875 blue candles, which I rounded to 17. TUTOR: Great. So we know that there are 45 red candles and a total of 8 in the actual ratio. So now lets look at the equation. We need to find the total number of candles to the total ration. For example If I had a ratio of red candles to blue candles as 3:2 and there were 6 red candles, we would know that there must be a total of 15 candles as 3x5=15.

5000120_2,"TUTOR: walk me through your solution TUTOR: walk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure. I started by setting up a proportion with the ratio of the shares of money between the three cousins and the amount Amy got. The ratio was 2:1:3, so I set up the proportion as 2:1:3 = x:50:y. Since we know that Amy got $50, I substituted y = 50. Then I simplified the ratio to 4:2:6 = x:50:50 and divided all terms by 2 to get 2:1:3 = x:25:25. Since Sandra's share is represented by the first term (2), I solved for x by setting up the equation 2/2 = x/25, which gave me x = 25. Therefore, Sandra got $25. TUTOR: Going by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts
Since Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100

Since she was supposed to eat 2 cups of kibble every day, I figured she should have eaten 2 cups on the first day. Then, I looked at how much kibble Mary and Frank had given her. Mary gave her 1 cup in the morning and 1 cup in the evening, so Luna has eaten 2 cups in total. Frank gave Luna 1 cup in the afternoon and twice as much (2 x 1 = 2 cups) in the late evening, so Luna has eaten 1 + 2 = 3 cups in total. So, I concluded that there should be 12 - 3 = 9 cups of kibble remaining in the bag the next morning.

5000128_3,"TUTOR: Hi Emily.  Can you explain how you worked out the answer? STUDENT: Sure. I started by figuring out how much birdseed Ivan refills the feeder with each week. Since the feeder holds two cups of birdseed, he refills it with two cups. Then, I figured out how much birdseed the squirrel steals from the feeder each week. Since the squirrel steals half a cup of birdseed every week, that means the amount of birdseed left for the birds is one cup minus half a cup, which equals 0.5 cup. Finally, I figured out how many birds the 0.5 cup of birdseed can feed. Since each cup of birdseed can feed 14 birds, 0.5 cup of birdseed can feed 14 divided by 2, which equals 7 birds. Therefore, Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 7 birds weekly. TUTOR: If I had 2 cookies and you stole half, how many cookies would I have left?",No

5000175_3,"TUTOR: How many thumbtacks does Lorenzo use from each can for one board? STUDENT: Lorenzo uses 3 thumbtacks from each can for one board. TUTOR: Not quite, read the problem again to find the correct answer...",No
5000175_4,"TUTOR: Hi Ronny, could you please walk me through your solution? TUTOR:  TUTOR: Hi Ronny, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure, I started by calculating how many thumbtacks were used for each board. I figured that since Lorenzo put three thumbtacks from each of the three cans into every board, he used a total of 3 x 3 = 9 thumbtacks for every board. Then I calculated how many boards he tested, which was 120, so he used a total of 9 x 120 = 1080 thumbtacks. Finally, I figured that since he had 30 thumbtacks remaining in each of the three cans, there were a total of 3 x 30 = 90 thumbtacks left. Therefore, the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans was 1080 + 90 = 1170. TUTOR: Lets try something different. Lets say that Joey has 3 packets of different flavour of candies. He puts  one candy from each pack into a box, and makes 100 such boxes. If he has 50 candies left after making 100 boxes, how many candies did he have in the beginning ?",No
5000176_4,"TUTOR: Hi can you talk me through your answer STUDENT: Sure. Ignatius owns 4 bicycles, so I figured that his friend must have 3 times as many tires since he has different types of cycles. I counted the tires from the unicycle and tricycle, which totaled 4, and then subtracted that from the total number of tires, which was 12. Since each bike has 2 tires, I divided the remaining 8 tires by 2, and got 4, so the friend must have 4 bicycles. TUTOR: Ok lets go back to the beginning how many tires do ignatius cycles have",No

I was subtracting one donut each day for the 12 days, but I should have subtracted 12 donuts from the total of 108 donuts at the beginning. So Jeff has 108-12 = 96 donuts left. Thanks for helping me understand this! TUTOR: If I made 5 donuts a day for 20 days, but ate one each day and if I go ahead and subtract one symbolizing the donuts I ate, for example: (5-1)x20= 80. There is no need to subtract donuts again representing the ones I ate, because I have already done so.",No
5000179_5,"TUTOR: Hi Jeff, talk me through your answer STUDENT: Jeff makes 10 donuts each day for 12 days. That means he makes 10 x 12 = 120 donuts. After Jeff eats one each day, he has 120-12 = 108 donuts left. After Chris eats 8 donuts, Jeff has 108-8 = 100 donuts left. Jeff can fill 100/10 = 10 boxes with his donuts. Since he can't have a fraction of a box, Jeff can fill 10 boxes with his donuts. TUTOR: Yes Jeff eats 12 and Chris eats 8 resulting in 100 donuts.

5000180_4,"TUTOR: Hi, can you explain your answer? STUDENT: Sure. I figured that since 8 jumbo scallops weigh one pound, then 2 jumbo scallops would weigh 1/4 pound. Since 1 pound of jumbo scallops costs $24.00, then 1/4 pound of jumbo scallops would cost $24.00/4 = $6.00. Then, since Nate is cooking for 8 people, he needs 2 scallops/person x 8 people = 16 scallops. So, 16 scallops would cost 16 scallops x $6.00/scallop = $96.00. TUTOR: It might be easier to start by working out how many scallops are needed in total. Can you do that?",No
5000180_5,"TUTOR: Hi Ronny, can you talk to me about how you approached this problem? STUDENT: Sure. I started by figuring out how much one pound of jumbo scallops cost, which was $24.00. Then I figured out that 1/4 pound of jumbo scallops cost $6.00. I then multiplied that by the number of people, 8, to get the total cost of 16 scallops, which was $96.00.

5000181_1,"TUTOR: Hello, please can you tell me why you did your third step? STUDENT: For my third step, I subtracted 10 from 15 to get the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas, which was 7.5. I did this because Billy is 3 times younger than Gladys, so his age is 30/3 = 10 years old. TUTOR: But in your third step you did not subtract 10 from 15, you divided 15 by 2. What do you get if you subtract 10 from 15?",No
5000181_2,"TUTOR: Hi Heidi.  The first line of your solution is correct: Billy is indeed 10 years old.  However, the rest of the solution isn't quite right.  Have another look at the first sentence of the question and see if you can give me a formula that represents the information given in it. STUDENT: I understand now. The age of Gladys is equal to twice the sum of the ages of Billy and Lucas. This can be represented as 2(Billy + Lucas) = 30.
So, Billy + Lucas = 15 and Lucas = 15 - 10 = 5 years old now.
In three years, Lucas will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

5000182_1,"TUTOR: Hi. Could you please guide me through the solution? STUDENT: Sure. First, I calculated the number of pens Clara has. Since Clara has 2/5 times as many pens as Alice, I multiplied 2/5 by 60, which is equal to 24. Then, I realized that the age difference between Alice and Clara is 24, since the difference in the number of pens that Alice and Clara each have matches their age difference. Since Alice is 20 years old, I added 24 to 20, which is equal to 44. This means that Clara is 44 years old. Finally, I added 5 to 44 to calculate Clara's age in 5 years, which is equal to 49. TUTOR: Are you sure 24 is the difference between the number of pens Alice and Clara has?",No
5000182_2,"TUTOR: Hi Ayisha, notice it says that the difference in pens is the age difference. STUDENT: Oh, I see! So if Alice is 20 years old, then Clara is 20 + 24 = 44 years old.

I added up the amount each person uses, which is 3+2+1+1 = 7 grams. Then I multiplied that by the number of times they brush their teeth each day, which is 4. That gave me 28 grams of toothpaste used per day. Then I divided the total amount of toothpaste (105 grams) by the amount used per day (28 grams) and got 3.75 days. Since they can't use a partial day of toothpaste, I rounded down to 3 days.

5000232_4,"TUTOR: Why did you start at 24 instead of at 20? STUDENT: started at 24 because I added the 20 sacks from the first harvest to the additional 4 sacks from the 20% increase in yield. TUTOR: But you just said it was 20 sacks at the first harvest, correct?",No
5000232_5,"TUTOR: Hi Hunter, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. After the first harvest, I calculated that the yield would increase by 20% of 20 sacks, which is 4 sacks. So the total number of sacks after the first harvest is 20 + 4 = 24 sacks. After the second harvest, I calculated that the yield would increase by 20% of 24 sacks, which is 4.8 sacks. So the total number of sacks after the second harvest is 24 + 4.8 = 28.8 sacks (rounded to one decimal place). TUTOR: Let's try to approach this differently. Say I win $100 in a lottery. Afterwards, I put this money in the bank and get 1% interest per year. So I will have $101 after one year. But at FIRST, I only had 100 dollars. The increase only happend AFTERWARDS.

Since they share the monthly savings, each person saves $1500/2 = $750 per month. TUTOR: so they are saving 1500 per month per person so 3000 in total.  Why did you divide the monthly amount a second time?",No
5000262_4,"TUTOR: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by figuring out how many cookies should have been taken in total. I knew that each neighbor was supposed to take 10 cookies, and there were 15 neighbors, so that meant there should have been 10 x 15 = 150 cookies taken. Then, I knew there were only 8 cookies left, so I subtracted 8 from 150 to get a total of 142 cookies taken. Since all the other neighbors took the correct amount, I knew that Sarah must have taken the remaining 2 cookies, so the answer is 2. TUTOR: Can you tell me how many neighbors took the correct number of cookies if Sarah took more and the last neighbor had only 8 left for her?",No

Then I added the amount Mike needed to take from the bank, which was $20000. So in total, he needed to pay $35000 + $20000 = $55000. Then I calculated the interest rate of 15%, which was 15/100 x $20000 = $3000. So in total, Mike needs to pay $55000 + $3000 = $58000 for the car. TUTOR: wow. That's an expensive loan.

I started by adding together Yulia's earnings from her lemonade stand and babysitting, which was $44 + $47 + $31 = $122. Then I let x be the amount she spent to run her lemonade stand. Then I set up an equation where her profit was equal to her total earnings minus the amount she spent on her lemonade stand, which was $47 - x. Then I set this equal to her total profit of $44 and solved for x, which was $3. Therefore, Yulia spent $3 to operate her lemonade stand.

5000315_3,"TUTOR: Hi Lakisha, Your solution is incorrect.  Please explain your solution. STUDENT: Hi, I thought that since Dr. Bronner's liquid soap can make twice as many bubbles per ounce as Dawn liquid soap, then one half ounce of the equal mixture would make 0.5 x 2 = 1 ounce of the equal mixture. Then I multiplied 200,000 by 2 to get 400,000 bubbles per ounce for Dr. Bronner's liquid soap and added that to 200,000 for Dawn liquid soap to get 600,000 bubbles. Then I multiplied 600,000 by 0.5 to get 300,000 bubbles for one half ounce of the equal mixture.

5000316_1,"TUTOR: Hi. Could you please guide me through the solution? STUDENT: Sure! First, I started by working backwards to find the total cups of lemonade Hazel made. She drank 1 cup, so that left 35 cups. She gave away half of 18 cups, which is 9 cups, so that left 26 cups. She sold half of her lemonade to the construction crew, so she had to make twice as much. Therefore, she sold 18 cups to the crew and kept 18 cups for herself and her friends. So, she made a total of 18 + 18 = 36 cups of lemonade. TUTOR: Hi. Could you please guide me through the solution?",No
5000316_2,"TUTOR: Keep in mind that Hazel sold half of her lemonade to the construction workers and her other half to everyone else STUDENT: Oh, that makes sense! So, she sold 18 cups to the construction workers and 18 cups to the kids on bikes, and gave away 9 cups to her friends. That means she made a total of 18 + 18 + 9 = 45 cups of lemonade TUTOR: Other than the construction workers who else has she sold to?",No
5000317_3,"TUTOR: Hi Jian. Can you explain why you got an answer of 20? STUDENT: Yes, I got 20 because there are 5 people at the party and each person needs to play 60 games. That means there are a total of 5 x 60 = 300 games played. Since it takes 2 tokens to play one game, they will need 2 x 300 = 600 tokens. Since 30 tokens cost $1, 600 tokens will cost 600/30 = $20.

Rhonda runs 200 meters in 24 seconds, so she runs 600 meters in 3 x 24 = 72 seconds. Sally runs 200 meters in 24 + 2 = 26 seconds, so she runs 600 meters in 3 x 26 = 78 seconds. Diane runs 200 meters in 24 - 3 = 21 seconds, so she runs 600 meters in 3 x 21 = 63 seconds.

Then, I added up the time it took each person to run 600 meters. Rhonda takes 72 seconds, Sally takes 78 seconds, and Diane takes 63 seconds. So, the three of them take 72 + 78 + 63 = 213 seconds to run the 600-meter relay race. TUTOR: Is Rhonda running the whole race?",No

I started by calculating how many chairs each worker produces in an hour, which is 4 chairs. Then I multiplied that by the number of workers, which is 3, to get 12 chairs per hour. Then I remembered that they produce an additional chair every 6 hours, so I calculated that they produce 1/6 of their hourly production per hour, which is 2 chairs per hour. Finally, I multiplied the total number of chairs produced per hour by the number of hours, which is 6, and added the additional chairs produced in that time, which is 2 x 6 = 12.

Since the moon has the same composition as Mars, the weight of the other elements on the moon is also 30% of its weight, which is 0.3x tons. Since we know that the weight of the other elements on Mars is 150 tons, we can set up the equation 0.3x = 150. Solving for x, we get x = 150/0.3 = 500. Therefore, the moon weighs 500 tons.

5000398_1,"TUTOR: Hi Brenda can you walk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure, I started by letting ""x"" be the number of years from now that Trevor's older brother will be three times as old as Trevor is now. So, I wrote the equation 20 + x = 3(11 + x). Then, I simplified the equation to get 2x = 13 and solved for x to get x = 6.5. That means in 6.5 years, Trevor's older brother will be three times as old as Trevor is now. So, Trevor will be 11 + 6.5 = 17.5 years old. TUTOR: your equation 20+x=3(11+x) is not quite right",No
5000398_3,"TUTOR: Hi Rishi, please talk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure, my solution was to set up an equation to solve for x, which is the number of years from now that this will happen. I started with the equation 20 + x = 3(11 + x), which I then simplified to 2x = 13. From there, I was able to solve for x, which was 6.5. This means that in 6.5 years, Trevor's older brother will be three times as old as Trevor is now, and Trevor will be 17.5 years old.

5000400_2,"TUTOR: Ho Michael, can you explain your answer? STUDENT: Sure. I used an equation to solve the problem. I set up an equation that said 12x = 26, where x is the number of pounds of cheese Tony bought. I then solved for x, and got x = 2.17. This means that Tony bought 2.17 pounds of cheese. TUTOR: OK, let's start with what we know. How much did he spend?",No
5000400_3,"TUTOR: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I said that Tony bought x pounds of cheese, so the cost of x pounds of cheese is 7x dollars. Then, the cost of 1 pound of beef is 5 dollars, so the cost of x pounds of beef is 5x dollars. Tony spent 7x + 5x = 12x dollars on cheese and beef. Tony had $87 before buying cheese and beef, and $61 after buying them, so he spent 87 - 61 = 26 dollars on cheese and beef. So, I set up an equation: 12x = 26. Solving for x, I got x = 2.17 (rounded to two decimal places). So, Tony bought 2.17 pounds of cheese. TUTOR: The equation seems to be a blunder. Are you confident that Tony brought equal amounts of beef and cheese as you have assumed the same variable x for both the quantities. This doesn't make any sense",No
5000400_4,"TUTOR: Hi Romy, You have made an error in your solution, but it's a good attempt at using algebra. TUTOR: If you read the problem.  The cheese is $7 a pound and we don't know how many pounds have been bought.  However, we do know that one pound of beef has been bought.  So the only missing variable is cheese.  Can you send me a new solution based on this? STUDENT: Sure! Let's say Tony bought x pounds of cheese. The cost of x pounds of cheese is 7x dollars. The cost of 1 pound of beef is 5 dollars, so the cost of x pounds of beef is 5 dollars. Tony spent 7x + 5 dollars = 12x dollars on cheese and beef. Tony had $87 before buying cheese and beef, and $61 after buying them, so he spent 87 - 61 = 26 dollars on cheese and beef. We can set up an equation: 12x = 26. Solving for x, we get x = 2.17 pounds of cheese. So Tony bought 2.17 pounds of cheese. TUTOR: What if you take the cost of the beef from the $87?",No

5000422_3,"TUTOR: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of female dogs. There were 40 dogs in total and 60% of them were female, so I multiplied 40 by 0.6 to get 24 female dogs. Then, I calculated the number of puppies that the female dogs gave birth to. Since 3/4 of the female dogs gave birth to 10 puppies each, I multiplied 3/4 by 24 to get 18 female dogs that gave birth. Since each female dog gave birth to 10 puppies, I multiplied 18 by 10 to get 180 puppies. This means that Tenisha had 40 original dogs plus 180 puppies, for a total of 220 puppies before donating some to the church. After donating 130 puppies, she was left with 220 - 130 = 90 puppies.

I used seconds because I wanted to find out how much faster Mac would run the 24 mile race compared to Apple. To do this, I first found out the difference in their running rates by subtracting Apple's rate from Mac's rate. Then, I divided the 24 mile race by the difference in their rates to find out how much faster Mac would run it. Finally, I converted the result to seconds to get the exact amount of time Mac would run the race faster than Apple TUTOR: Do you remember the original question?",No
5000454_4,"TUTOR: Hi. Could you please guide me through your solution ? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the rate at which Apple and Mac can run in miles per minute. Apple can run 3 miles per hour, so 3 x 60 = 180 miles per minute. Mac can run 4 miles per hour, so 4 x 60 = 240 miles per minute. The difference in their rates is 240 - 180 = 60 miles per minute. To run a 24 mile race, Mac will run it 24/60 = 0.4 minutes faster than Apple. Converting 0.4 minutes to seconds gives us 0.4 x 60 = 24 seconds. TUTOR: Okay. Let's focus on speed.

Since he didn't get caught by his wife, he went back the next day and took another 3 cookies out of the jar. But after eating just one of the cookies, he felt guilty about it and put the other two cookies back. His son, Louie Junior saw that his Dad was eating cookies. So, Louie Junior took seven cookies out of the jar and hid them in his bedroom for later. The next morning, Debra, Lou's wife looked into the cookie jar and reacted by accusing her husband of eating half of the cookies out of the cookie jar.

To solve this problem, I used the information given to calculate the number of cookies taken out of the jar. Firstly, Lou Senior ate 3 cookies and then put 2 back, so he effectively ate 3-2=1 cookie. Secondly, Louie Junior took 7 cookies out of the jar. So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar is 1+7 = 8 cookies. If 8 cookies were half of the jar, then the whole jar had 8 x 2 = 16 cookies. Since 8 cookies were taken out, there are 16-8 = 8 cookies remaining in the jar.

So, the total number of cookies taken out of the jar is 1+7 = 8 cookies.

Then, I used the information that 8 cookies were half of the jar to figure out how many cookies were in the jar originally. If 8 cookies were half of the jar, then the whole jar had 8 x 2 = 16 cookies.

Finally, I subtracted the number of cookies taken out of the jar from the total number of cookies in the jar to get the number of cookies remaining in the jar. Since 8 cookies were taken out, there are 16-8 = 8 cookies remaining in the jar. TUTOR: Ok. Let's focus on something different.

Since the tank was 1/3 full before, that means it was already filled with 2/3 of its capacity. So if the tank was 2/3 full, then the full capacity of the tank would be 3 times the amount of water that was already in the tank. That's why I set up the equation 2/3x + 16 = x. I was trying to find out how much water was in the tank before 16 gallons were added, which would be the full capacity of the tank.

5000634_2,"TUTOR: could you please walk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure. Jessica needs 1.5 apples for each serving, and she has 12 guests. She plans to make 3 pies, which each contain 8 servings. So she needs 12 x 3 = 36 apples to make 3 pies. She has 12 x 3 = 36 servings since each pie has 8 servings and she made 3 pies. Therefore, each guest eats 36/12 = 3 servings on average. So each guest eats 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 apples on average. TUTOR: lets consider this. if you make 2 bottles of lemonade and each bottle can serve 4 people then how will you calculate the total number of servings?",No
5000634_3,"TUTOR: Hi Luca! Can you walk me through the steps you used to solve this problem? STUDENT: Sure! First, I calculated that Jessica needs 1.5 apples for each serving, and she has 8 servings per pie. So she needs 1.5 x 8 = 12 apples for one pie. Then, she needs 12 x 3 = 36 apples for 3 pies. Next, since each pie has 8 servings, she has 12 x 3 = 36 servings in total. Finally, I divided 36 by 12 to find the average number of servings per guest, which is 3. Then, I multiplied 3 by 1.5 to find the average number of apples per guest, which is 4.5. TUTOR: Let's start by figuring our how many servings of pie there are",No

5000638_2,"TUTOR: Try starting again with the question. If Bens pays $400 per month on his car which is 20% of his aftertax payment then what is his payment after tax? STUDENT: Ben pays $400 per month on his car, which is 20% of his after-tax income. So, if we let x be his gross income, then his after-tax income is (2/3)x. Since he spends 20% of his after-tax income on his car, he spends 0.2(2/3)x = (1/3)x on his car. Since he spends $400 on his car, (1/3)x = $400. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = $1200. Therefore, Ben makes $1200 per month before taxes. TUTOR: If 20% = £400 then how much do you think 100% might equal?",No
5000639_1,"TUTOR: Hello, Ronny. Can you walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. On the first day, Paul eats 2 sandwiches.

Finally, for the fourth week, I subtracted 5 miles from the previous week, meaning she ran 7-5 = 2 miles. So, the week she was injured, she ran 2 miles. TUTOR: In your last calculation, you said you used the figure from the previous week, is this the case if you review your solution?",No
5000660_1,"TUTOR: Hi Heidi, can you tell me how you got your answer? STUDENT: Yes, I started by dividing the 20 chocolate bars evenly amongst the 5 people, which gave each person 4 chocolate bars. Then I realized that each person had to give up half of their chocolate bars, so each person only had 2 chocolate bars left. I multiplied 2 chocolate bars by 4 people to get 8 chocolate bars, which is how many the father received. Then I subtracted 3 for the mother and 2 for the father to get 3 chocolate bars left. TUTOR: But Matilda had 4 sisters, so there were 5 people total who each got 4 chocolate bars",No
5000660_2,"TUTOR: Hi Lakisha, can you talk me through how you worked out the answer STUDENT: Sure, I started by figuring out how many chocolate bars each sister got. There were 20 chocolate bars and 5 people, so each sister got 20/5 = 4 chocolate bars. Then, I figured out how many chocolate bars the father got. Each sister gave up half of their chocolate bars, so each had 4/2 = 2 chocolate bars left. So, the father got 4 x 2 = 8 chocolate bars from his daughters. Finally, I subtracted the 3 chocolate bars he gave to their mother and the 2 he ate, so he had 8 - 3 - 2 = 3 chocolate bars left.

5000661_5,"TUTOR: Scott, walk me through your solution TUTOR: Scott, walk me through your solution STUDENT: I started by subtracting 15 minutes for the time Dante spent walking to Hidden Lake from the total time he was gone, which was 32 minutes. Then I subtracted the 7 minutes it took him to walk back to the Park Office, leaving me with 10 minutes. I then reasoned that if he had walked to the restaurant before going to Hidden Lake, he would have spent 10 minutes walking from the Park Office to the restaurant. So I set up an equation to figure out how long the walk from the Park Office to the restaurant was: 15 + 10 - x = 32. Solving for x, I got x = 7, which means the walk from the Park Office to the restaurant takes 7 minutes. TUTOR: How many minutes was Dante on the trip to Hidden Lake and then to Park Office?",No

5000663_2,"TUTOR: Hello Riya. Can you please explain how you came to your solution for me? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of coconut trees in Rohan's farm. There are 20 square meters and each square meter has 2 trees, so the total number of trees is 20 x 2 = 40. Then I calculated the number of coconuts that can be harvested in 6 months. Each tree yields 6 coconuts every 3 months, so in 6 months there will be 6 x 4 = 24 coconuts per tree. Multiplying this by the total number of trees gives us 40 x 24 = 960 coconuts. Finally, I multiplied the total number of coconuts by the price per coconut, which is $0.50. This gives us 960 x $0.50 = $480. TUTOR: Excellent start Riya. To begin, how many times does 3 months happen in a 6 month period.",Yes

The total cost of the trip including medical bills is $1200 + $700 = $1900. So Tom will have to pay $140 + $1900 = $2040 in total. TUTOR: This part of your calculation is incorrect. Have another go. The total cost of the trip including medical bills is $1200 + $700 = $1900. So Tom will have to pay $140 + $1900 = $2040 in total.",No
5000692_4,"TUTOR: Hi Alejandra. Could you please tell me guide me through the last few steps of the solution' STUDENT: Sure. So, after we calculated the cost of the medical bills, we need to figure out how much insurance will cover. Insurance covers 80% of the medical bills, so Tom will pay 20% of $700 = $140. 
Then, we need to add the cost of the medical bills to the cost of the trip. The total cost of the trip including medical bills is $1200 + $700 = $1900.
Finally, we need to add the cost of the medical bills and the cost of the trip to get the total cost of the trip. Tom will have to pay $140 + $1900 = $2040 in total. TUTOR: Why did you include $ 700 in the total cost of the trip? Is Tom really paying $ 700 from his pocket?",No
5000694_1,"TUTOR: Hi Winnie.  Can you explain to me how you worked out how much Kendra sold in 2015 please? STUDENT: Sure. In 2014, Kendra made $8000 less than Laurel, which is $30000 - $8000 = $22000. In 2015, Kendra made 20% more than Laurel made in 2014, which is 20/100 * $30000 = $6000 more. So Kendra's earnings in 2015 is $22000 + $6000 = $28000. Therefore, Kendra's total earnings in the two years is $22000 + $28000 = $50000. TUTOR: Let's have another look at Kendra's 2015 sales.  You are correct in that if she made 20% more than Laurel made in 2014, which was $30000, this would amount to $6000 more, but it's 20% more than Laurel earned in 2014.  Have another go please.",No

5000717_1,"TUTOR: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the total number of books that Carlos read in July and August, which was 28 + 30 = 58 books. Then, I realized that he needed to read 100 books during his summer vacation, so I subtracted 58 from 100, which gave me 42. I then assumed that x was the number of books that Carlos read in June, so I set up the equation x + 58 = 100 - 42. After solving the equation, I got x = 0, which meant that Carlos did not need to read any books in June because he had already read enough books in July and August to meet his goal of 100 books for the summer.

5000746_1,"TUTOR: Hi hunter, can you talk me through your steps in how you got the answer of 38? STUDENT: Sure. I started by realizing that the two big toes take up the same space as two regular toenails. So, I added 20 big toenails and 2 regular toenails to get 22 regular toenails. Then, I subtracted 22 from 100 to get 78, which is the number of regular toenails that can fit in the jar. Finally, I subtracted 40 regular toenails from 78 to get 38, which is the number of regular toenails that can fit in the remainder of the jar. TUTOR: do you think you could read back through the origonal question and see if you read it differently ?",No
5000746_3,"TUTOR: Hi Cody, can you tell me how you got to your answer? STUDENT: Yes, I figured that since there are 20 big toenails and 40 regular toenails already in the jar, that the total number of toenails taking up the same space as regular toenails is 20 + 2 = 22. Then, I subtracted 22 from 100 to get 78, and then subtracted 40 from 78 to get 38. TUTOR: Okay, so if 20 big toenails take up the same amount of space as 40 regular toenails, how many regular toenails is a big toenail equal to?",No
5000747_1,"TUTOR: Hi Michael, can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I started by calculating that one cup of cream has 226.8 grams of fat. Then, I divided that by 4 because the recipe serves four people, so each serving had 56.7 grams of cream. After that, I multiplied the amount of cream by 0.5 because Perry added a half cup of cream, so that was 113.4 grams of cream. Finally, I divided that by 4 to get the amount of fat added to each serving, which was 28.35 grams. TUTOR: Wow, that seems like a lot of fat per serving! Could you look at the question again and work out whether you really need to work out the ounces?",No
5000747_4,"TUTOR: Hi Jordy can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the amount of fat in one cup of cream, which is 8 x 28.35 = 226.8 grams. Then, I divided that by 4 to get the amount of fat in each serving, which is 56.7 grams. Finally, I multiplied that by 0.5 to get the amount of fat added to each serving, which is 28.35 grams. TUTOR: Read the question again. How many grams of fat are in a cup?",No
5000748_4,"TUTOR: Hi Jian, how are you? STUDENT: Hi, I'm doing well. TUTOR: Great!  Let's have a look at this problem together as I think you're a bit confused. Firstly , how long will it take Austin to descend 270 steps?",Yes
5000748_5,"TUTOR: Hi Brenda, can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I figured that the elevator will take 60 seconds to get to the ground floor. So, Austin descends 9 x 30 = 270 steps in 60 seconds. Thus, Austin descends 270/60 = 4.5 steps per second. Therefore, Jake will take 270/3 = 90 seconds to get to the ground floor. So, Jake will get to the ground floor 90 seconds later than Austin. TUTOR: OK - you have correctly identified that it takes Austin 60seconds to get down in the elevator. We dont need to work out how many seconds per step this is. Just note this and put to one side for now. You have also correctly identified that it will take Jake 90s to get down based on the information that you have. What is the next step you need to take to work out what the time difference is?",No

I figured out that James was 15 years old and his older brother was 19 years old. I used a calculator to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. TUTOR: I agree that John was  36. If I am 40 now, how old will I be in 6 years",No
5000750_3,"TUTOR: Hi, can you explain your answer please? STUDENT: Sure. I started by saying that three years ago, John was 39 - 3 = 36 years old. Then I said that James is currently x years old, so three years ago, James was x - 3 years old. In 6 years, James will be x + 6 years old. So, 3 years ago, John was twice as old as James will be in 6 years: 36 = 2(x + 6 - 3). From there, I used algebra to solve for x, which is 15. So, James is currently 15 years old, and his older brother is 15 + 4 = 19 years old. TUTOR: It's easier to work this out in steps, rather than using algebra. Let's start at the beginning. What age was John 3 years ago?",No

Then 1/6 of the starting number were eaten by insects, so 50 seeds were eaten. That left 150 seeds, and half of those sprouted, but all of them were eaten, so none survived long enough to flower. TUTOR: You're correct that 150 seeds remain after being eaten or dying in water. What happens to those remaining 150 seeds that survive?",No
5000751_5,"TUTOR: Hi Jian, could you walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started with 300 seeds. 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die, so 2/3 are left, which is 200 seeds. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten by insects, so (1/6) x 300 = 50 seeds are eaten. Thus, 200 - 50 = 150 are left. Half of the remainder sprout, so (1/2) x 150 = 75 sprout. However, all 75 sprouts are immediately eaten, so none survive long enough to flower. 0 TUTOR: Okay so could you tell me what 1/3 of 300 is?",No
5000752_1,"TUTOR: Hi Ronny, please can you talk me through your working? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of quarters she had, which was 350/5 = 70. Then I put aside 2/5 of the quarters, which was 28. So the remaining quarters were 70-28 = 42. Then I multiplied the number of quarters by 0.25 to calculate the value of the quarters, which was 42*0.25 = $10.5. Then I multiplied the number of dimes by 0.10 to calculate the value of the dimes, which was 350*0.10 = $35. Finally, I added the value of the quarters and dimes together to get the total combined value, which was $10.5 + $35 = $45.5.

Then I used the fact that the mother was twice as old as the daughter 5 years ago to calculate that the mother was 2x years old 5 years ago. Then I used the fact that the mother is now 41 years old to calculate that she was 36 years old 5 years ago. From that, I determined that x must be 18. So the daughter was 13 years old 5 years ago. Therefore, she is now 18 years old and in 3 years she will be 21 years old. TUTOR: Good, you've correctly idenitfied the daughter as being 18 years old 5 years ago. If she was 18 5 years ago, how old would she be now?",Yes
5000757_4,"TUTOR: Hello DeAndre, please can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by assuming that the daughter's age 5 years ago was x. Then I used the fact that the mother was twice as old as the daughter 5 years ago, so the mother's age 5 years ago was 2x. Next, I used the given information that the mother is 41 years old now, so her age 5 years ago was 41-5=36. That means 2x=36, and x=18. So the daughter was 18-5=13 years old 5 years ago. Now the daughter is 13+5=18 years old. Therefore, in 3 years, the daughter will be 18+3=21 years old. TUTOR: You have calculated the age of the mother 5 years ago correctly (36).

Each glass is missing 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of its capacity, so each glass has 6 x 1/5 = 1.2 ounces of water missing. Then I added up all the missing water from all 10 glasses, which is 1.2 x 10 = 12 ounces of water missing. Finally, I calculated how much water is needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim, which is 6 x 10 = 60 ounces of water. So, 60 - 12 = 48 ounces of water are needed to fill all 10 glasses to the brim. TUTOR: Ahh I see, 48 ounces of water is a lot considering they are all 4/5 full.

Then I calculated the cost of the trousers, which was 10 x $9 = $90. After that, I calculated the cost of the shirts, which was (x - 2) x $5 = $5x - $10. Then I added the cost of the trousers and shirts together to get the total bill, which was $90 + ($5x - $10) = $5x + $80. Since the bill was $140, then I set up the equation $5x + $80 = $140. I then subtracted $80 from both sides to get $5x = $60. Finally, I divided both sides by $5 to get x = 12. This meant that Leo had dropped off 12 shirts and the number of missing shirts was 12 - 2 = 10. TUTOR: In a shop trousers are $25 and tops are $15.

STUDENT: Sure, my solution was that if one person takes 10 hours to solve the problem, then the work required is 1 x 10 = 10 person-hours. If two people work together, they can divide the work between them, so each person only needs to do half the work. So, each person needs to do 10/2 = 5 person-hours of work. Therefore, the two of them will have to work for 5 + 5 = 10 hours to solve the same problem. TUTOR: I like how you determined that 1 person would take 10 hours to solve the problem.

In step 4, I took the amount that Juanita spends a week, which is $5.00, and multiplied it by 52 weeks in a year. That gave me the total amount that Juanita spends in a year, which is $1820.00. Then I subtracted the amount that Grant spends in a year, which is $200.00, from the amount that Juanita spends in a year, which is $1820.00. That gave me the difference between what Grant spends and what Juanita spends, which is $1620.00.

I then multiplied 15% by 26 to get the additional amount Gina needs to tip, which is 0.15 x 26 = $3.90 or 390 cents. Therefore, Gina would need to tip an additional 390 - 130 = 260 cents to be considered a good tipper.

Then, since there were 60 girls, I used the ratio to find the total number of people at the dance, which is 60/(4/7) = 105. I then let x be the number of boys, and used the ratio to solve for x, which is 3/4 = x/60, so x = 45. Finally, I used the fact that the number of teachers is 20% of the number of boys, which is 0.2*45 = 9. Therefore, the total number of people at the dance is 105 + 45 + 9 = 159.

If each female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, then 50 x 2 = 100 gallons of milk will be produced a day.
Since the farmer has 50 male cows, they don't produce milk, so the total milk produced a day is 100 gallons.

She can travel another 5 x 20 = 100 miles with this amount of gas left. Therefore, Carol can travel a total of 220 + 100 = 320 miles without filling her tank again. TUTOR: Reconsider the last step. She has already travelled the 220 miles. The question asks how much much she can travel? Is there any mistake there? What do you think?",No
5000872_4,"TUTOR: Hello, Brenda. Walk me through your solution TUTOR: Hello, Brenda. Walk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating how many miles Carol can travel on a full tank of gas. I multiplied 20 miles per gallon by 16 gallons, which gave me 320 miles. Then, I divided 220 miles by 20 miles per gallon, which gave me 11 gallons of gas. After traveling 220 miles, Carol would have 16 - 11 = 5 gallons of gas left in her tank. Finally, I multiplied 5 gallons by 20 miles per gallon to get 100 miles, and added that to the 220 miles she already traveled to get a total of 320 miles without needing to fill her tank again.

First, I realized that the length of the rope is the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 2(l+w), where l and w are the length and width of the rectangle. Since the longer sides of the rectangle are 28cm long, that means 2l = 28, so l = 14.

Next, I used the fact that the perimeter of the rectangle is 100cm, so 2(14+w) = 100. Simplifying the equation gives 28+2w = 100, so 2w = 72 and w = 36.

5000932_2,"TUTOR: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by noting that the tree was already 24 inches tall when it was planted. Then I realized that the boy would grow 12 inches from 24 to 36 inches. Since the tree grows twice as fast as the boy, it would grow 24 inches in the same amount of time. So the final height of the tree would be 24 + 24 = 48 inches. TUTOR: On the day the tree was planted, the boy was 24 inches tall and the tree was 16 inches tall. Not 24 inches. Do you get it?",No

So, 1 latte with vanilla syrup was $4.00 + $0.50 = $4.5. Then I calculated the cost of the 2 cold brew coffees, which was 2 x $2.50 = $5. Lastly, I added up all the costs, which was $4.5 + $4.5 + $3.50 + $8 + $5 + $3.50 = $29. TUTOR: You did many things right but have one little mistake.

5000959_4,"TUTOR: can you walk me through your solution stepwise? STUDENT: Sure. First, I recognized that three-fifths of the children were boys, which means two-fifths must be girls since the total must be 5/5 or 1 whole. To find how many girls there are, I set up a proportion: 3/5 = x/50, where x is the number of girls. Then, I cross-multiplied to solve for x: 3 x 50 = 5 x x, and I got x = 30. Therefore, there are 30 girls at the party. TUTOR: you can do it with using any ratio proportion concept. just use the concept of fractions.",No
5000960_1,"TUTOR: Hi Emily, can you walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I started by figuring out how many words Abigail still had to type. I knew she had already written 200 words, so I subtracted that from the total of 1000 words she needed to write. That left me with 800 words. 

Then, I knew that Abigail could type 300 words in half an hour, so I multiplied that by two to figure out how many words she could type in one hour. That was 600 words. 

Next, I divided that by 60 to figure out how many words she could type in one minute. That was 10 words. 

Finally, I divided the 800 words she still had to type by 10 to figure out how many minutes it would take her. That was 80 minutes.

I know that the queen lays 3000 eggs each day and 900 bees are lost each day, so the total number of bees left in the hive is 3000 - 900 = 2100. Then, I multiplied the number of bees lost each day (900) by the number of days (7) to get the total number of bees that left the hive, which is 6300. Finally, I subtracted 6300 from the initial number of bees (12500) to get the total number of bees left in the hive at the end of 7 days, which is 6200. Since the queen is still in the hive, the total number of bees in the hive at the end of 7 days, including the queen, is 6200 + 1 = 6201. TUTOR: This is correct you have 6300 fewer bees.

I let x represent the number of cans Jack recycled, so I knew that he made 10 cents per bottle and 5 cents per can. I multiplied 10 cents by 80 bottles to get his earnings from the bottles, which was 800 cents or $8. Then I multiplied 5 cents by x cans to get his earnings from the cans, which was 0.05x dollars. I added the two together to get his total earnings, which was 800 + 0.05x = 1500 cents or $15. Then I simplified the equation to 0.05x = 700 and divided both sides by 0.05 to get x = 1400/5 = 280.

5000989_1,"TUTOR: Hello Scott, please can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of days for jury selection and the trial. Jury selection takes 2 days and the trial itself lasts 4 times as long, so that's 8 days. Then I calculated the number of hours spent in jury deliberation. The number of hours was equivalent to 6 full days, so 6 x 8 = 48 hours. Since they spend 16 hours a day in deliberation, then 48/16 = 3 days. So, the total number of days John spends on jury duty is 2 + 8 + 3 = 13 days. TUTOR: You are right with the first two parts. What do you think the sentence ' The number of hours spent in jury deliberation was the equivalent of 6 full day' means?",No

Can you have another look at the question to see where you made the mistake? STUDENT: Oh, I see. I was supposed to divide the 48 hours by 16 hours, not multiply. So the total days spent in deliberation is 48/16 = 3 days. So the total days John spends on jury duty is 2 + 8 + 3 = 13 days. TUTOR: Not quite.  The question says the equivalent of 6 full days.  How many hours in a day?",No

Then I figured out how many days the trial lasted, which was four times as long as jury selection, so it was eight days. Then I figured out how many hours were spent in jury deliberation, which was six days, so that was 48 hours. Since they spent 16 hours a day in deliberation, I divided 48 by 16 to get three days. So, I added up the two days for jury selection, the eight days for the trial, and the three days for jury deliberation, and I got thirteen days. TUTOR: Let's change the problem.

So the total number of people on the bus was 48 + 50 = 98. Then I subtracted the carrying capacity of the bus, which was 80, from 98. This gave me -18, which I interpreted to mean that there were 0 people who could not take the bus because it was full (meaning that the bus was over capacity by 18 people).

We know that at the first pickup point, 3/5 of the carrying capacity, which is 48 people, entered the bus. Then, at the next pickup point, there were 50 people. So, we can add the two numbers together to get 98 people on the bus. Since the carrying capacity of the bus is only 80 people, that means that there were 18 people too many for the bus, so 0 people could not take the bus because it was full.

Finally, I added 52 and 80 together to get the total number of pies sold, which was 132. TUTOR: I see. But we're dealing with individual pies here, rather than slices.  If you had a birthday cake, and lots of guests at your party, you couldn't just keep producing slices of cake.  Can you think of another way to figure out how everyone gets a piece?",No
5001017_2,"TUTOR: Hi Heidi, Can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure, I started by calculating how many slices of shepherd's pie Chef Michel made. I multiplied 4 (the number of pieces in each pie) by 52 (the number of customers who ordered slices of shepherd's pie) to get 208. Then, I calculated how many slices of chicken pot pie Chef Michel made. I multiplied 5 (the number of pieces in each pie) by 80 (the number of customers who ordered slices of chicken pot pie) to get 400. Next, I calculated how many shepherd's pies Chef Michel sold by dividing 208 by 4, which gave me 52. Then, I calculated how many chicken pot pies Chef Michel sold by dividing 400 by 5, which gave me 80. Finally, I added the number of shepherd's pies and the number of chicken pot pies to get the total number of pies Chef Michel sold, which was 52 + 80 = 132. TUTOR: OK. Lets simplify this a little. If four customers wanted shepherds pie then how many pies would that be?",No

STUDENT: Sure, my solution was that if there were 63 cannoneers and none of them were women, then there were 63 x 0 = 0 women. The number of women was double the number of cannoneers, so there were 2 x 63 = 126 women. The total number of men is twice the number of women, so there were 2 x 126 = 252 men. Altogether, there were 63 + 126 + 252 = 441 people in total. TUTOR: What gender are the cannoneers?",No
5001019_4,"TUTOR: Hello - which gender/sex do you think the canoneers must be? STUDENT: The cannoneers must be men since none of them were women. TUTOR: Great, so they make up some of the 252 men. What is the total number of people?",Yes
5001020_1,"TUTOR: Hi Luca,  can you explain your thinking when you were figuring out how many total hours Rita should swim...it's your 3rd step STUDENT: Sure. I knew that Rita had already completed a total of 50+9+121 = 180 hours of swimming. So I subtracted that from the total of 1,500 hours that her coach required her to swim, which left me with 1,500 - 180 = 1320 hours. I then knew that Rita was going to dedicate 220 hours every month to practicing freestyle and sidestroke, so I multiplied that by two to get a total of 440 hours per month. Finally, I divided the remaining hours (1320) by the hours she swims every month (440) to get 3. Therefore, Rita has to swim for 3 more months to fulfill her coach's requirements. TUTOR: Let's look at what you did to find how many hours Rita will swim each month...we know she will dedicate 220 hrs/month.What was your thinking by multilplying that number by 2?",No
5001020_2,"TUTOR: Talk me through your solution? STUDENT: I started by adding the hours Rita had already completed, which was 50+9+121 = 180 hours. Then I subtracted that from the total 1,500 hours she needed to swim, so 1,500 - 180 = 1320 hours. I then realized that Rita was dedicating 220 hours each month to practicing freestyle and sidestroke, so 220 x 2 = 440 hours. To figure out how many months it would take her to fulfill her coach's requirements, I divided the remaining hours (1320) by the hours she swims every month (440) and got 3. So Rita has to swim for 3 more months to fulfill her coach's requirements. TUTOR: I see your issue.

Then, I subtracted this from the total hours she needs to swim: 1,500 - 180 = 1320 hours. I then calculated how many hours she will swim every month: 220 x 2 = 440 hours. Finally, I divided the remaining hours (1320) by the hours she swims every month (440): 1320/440 = 3. Therefore, Rita has to swim for 3 more months to fulfill her coach's requirements. TUTOR: i can see you have worked the majority of this out correctly. can you confirm how you arrived at the number of 440 hours a month she is going to swim for?",Yes
5001020_4,TUTOR: Can you explain why you multiplied 220 with 2? STUDENT: I multiplied 220 with 2 because I wanted to find out how many hours Rita will be swimming each month. 220 hours of freestyle and 220 hours of sidestroke adds up to 440 hours of swimming every month.

This was 50 hours of backstroke, 9 hours of breaststroke, and 121 hours of butterfly, which added up to 180 hours. Then I subtracted this from the total of 1,500 hours that her coach required her to swim. This left me with 1,500 - 180 = 1320 hours. Since Rita plans to dedicate 220 hours every month to practicing freestyle and sidestroke, I divided the remaining hours by the hours she swims every month: 1320/440 = 3. This means that Rita has to swim for 3 more months to fulfill her coach's requirements. TUTOR: Why do you think Rita was swimming 440 hours per month?",No

Do you have any ideas on how to approach this? STUDENT: Yes, I think I can do this. To find out how much money is needed to buy the aquarium, we need to multiply the profit per goldfish by the number of goldfish sold. So, $0.5 x 90 = $45. This means that the owner is $45 short of the $100 price. To find out what percentage this is, we can divide $45 by $100 and multiply by 100. So, 45/100 x 100 = 45%. Therefore, the owner is 45% short of the price. TUTOR: So, the owner is $45 short of the price. Another thing we can work out is how much money the owner made selling the goldfish.

So I started by assuming that Genevieve bought x kilograms of cherries. Then I calculated the cost of x kilograms of cherries at $8 per kilogram, which was 8x dollars. Then I realized that if Genevieve had $400 more, the total cost would be 8x + $400. But since Genevieve only had $1600, I set up an equation: 8x + $400 = $1600. After subtracting $400 from both sides, I got 8x = $1200. Then I divided both sides by 8 and got x = 150. So Genevieve bought 150 kilograms of cherries. TUTOR: Now lets consider this exemplar problem. Lets say one chocolate costs $1.

Since Puffy has half as many whiskers as Scruffy, then Scruffy has 36 x 2 = 72 whiskers. Then I added up the total number of whiskers on the four cats: 36 + 12 + 72 + Buffy = 120. Since Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average of the other three cats, then Buffy has 120 - 36 - 12 - 72 = 0 whiskers. TUTOR: Puffy and Scruffy are correct.

Then, I found that the proceeds from the sale is 0.8X, and she needs $4,000 more to buy a new $30,000 car. So, I set up the equation 0.8X + $4,000 = $30,000. Then, I subtracted $4,000 from both sides, which gave me 0.8X = $26,000. After that, I divided both sides by 0.8, which gave me X = $32,500. Finally, I found that her new car is $32,500 - 0.8X = $32,500 - $26,000 = $6,500 cheaper than what she originally paid for her old car. TUTOR: How much did her new car cost?",No

Then I calculated the value of the 2 baseball cards that Matt traded to Jane, which was 2 x $6 = $12. Next, I calculated the value of the 3 $2 cards that Jane gave to Matt, which was 3 x $2 = $6. Finally, I added the value of the $9 card that Jane gave to Matt, which was $9, to get the total value of what Matt received from Jane, which was $12 + $6 + $9 = $27. I then subtracted the total value of what Matt had from the total value of what Matt received to get the profit, which was $27 - $48 = $-21. TUTOR: Okay good. Lets take it step by step. What is the value of the cards Matt trades with Jane?",Yes

5001077_1,"TUTOR: Hi Jordy, please can you walk me through the solution? STUDENT: Sure. First, I calculated how much Pablo earns from reading each book. Since he earns 1 cent for each page, and each book is 150 pages, he earns 150 x 0.01 = $1.5 for each book. Let's call the number of books he read ""b"". So, his earnings are also equal to b x 1.5. 

We know that his earnings from reading books plus his $3 leftover equals $15 worth of candy, so we can write an equation: b x 1.5 + 3 = 15. Subtracting 3 from both sides: b x 1.5 = 12. Dividing both sides by 1.5: b = 8. Therefore, Pablo read 8 books. TUTOR: Okay, I can see you have over complicated this, let's work backwards. Can you tell me how much money Pablo had altogether?",No

5001097_2,TUTOR: Hi Rishi - what is your solution? STUDENT: My solution is that it took Jack 20 seconds to run up the second half of the hill. TUTOR: Explain how you got that answer please,No
5001097_5,"TUTOR: Can you walk me through your soution STUDENT: Sure. I started by noting that Jack's total time to run up the hill was 19 seconds for the first half plus x seconds for the second half, where x is the time it took him to run up the second half. I then noted that Jill's total time to run up the hill was x plus 7 plus 32 seconds. Since they both ran up the same hill, their total time should be the same, so I set up an equation: 19 + x = x + 7 + 32. I then simplified and solved for x, which gave me x = 20. Therefore, it took Jack 20 seconds to run up the second half of the hill. TUTOR: Since Jack was faster than Jill, his total running time must have been 32 - 7 = 25 seconds.",No

6000013_1,"TUTOR: Hi Brenda, how are you feeling about this problem? TUTOR: Hi Brenda, can you talk me through your method here? STUDENT: Hi! I understand that Charlie needs to make and sell 20 candles. I know that for every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles and that one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. So, I figured that Charlie can make 10 x 1 = 10 candles from one pound of beeswax. The cost of supplies per candle is $10.00 / 10 = $1.00. Charlie's profit per candle is $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00. If he makes and sells 20 candles, Charlie's total revenue is $2.00 x 20 = $40.00. His total cost for supplies is $10.00. His total profit is $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00. TUTOR: You've done rteally well on this and you're almost there but you've calculated the cost of supplies wrongly.  How many lots of wax/wicks did Charlie need to buy?",Yes
6000013_4,"TUTOR: Here I see you taking away $10 from 40$? STUDENT: Yes, I took away $10 from $40 because that was the cost of supplies for the 20 candles. I understand now that I need to add the cost of supplies to the total revenue to get the net profit. So the net profit is $40 + $10 = $50. TUTOR: I think if you look back you have taken the supplies of when working out your profit by candle?",No
6000013_5,"TUTOR: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. To solve this problem, I started by calculating how many candles Charlie can make from one pound of beeswax. I found that he can make 10 candles. Then, I calculated the cost of supplies per candle, which is $10.00 divided by 10, which equals $1.00. After that, I found the profit per candle, which is $2.00 minus $1.00, which equals $1.00. Finally, I calculated the total profit by multiplying the profit per candle by the number of candles sold, which is 20 candles. So, the total profit is $1.00 x 20, which equals $30.00. TUTOR: there seems to be a misunderstanding here. are you sure that his total cost for supplies was $10?",No

Then I used 220 post-it notes at work, leaving me with 23 post-it notes remaining. So I used a total of 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes. Since I bought a package of post-it notes, the number of post-it notes I bought is the difference between the total I used and the number I started with: 277 - 80 = 197. TUTOR: Okay, so you've started off well. However, your calculation isn' correct. Can you look again at the calculation in the middle and think about it a bit more?",No
6000014_3,"TUTOR: Scott, please read the question again and see if you get a differnet answer STUDENT: Candice started with 80 post-it notes.
She used 220 post-it notes at work.
She had 23 post-it notes remaining.
So she used a total of 80 + 220 - 23 = 277 post-it notes.
However, she only bought a package of post-it notes, so she must have had more post-it notes to start with.
The number of post-it notes she bought is the difference between the total she used and the number she started with: 277 - 80 = 197.
So the answer is 197 post-it notes. TUTOR: lets take it one step at a time we know she used 220 post it notes, and had 23 remaining so what do we need to do with these two numbers?",No

Then I added the 5 spoons her husband bought, so the total number of spoons was x + 5. Then I subtracted the 3 spoons Julia used to sample the stew, so she had 9 spoons left. I set up an equation that x + 5 = 9, and then I subtracted 5 from both sides to get x = 4. So the answer is that Julia bought a package of 4 spoons. TUTOR: Ok, You've overcomplicated this. It only requires addition and subtraction. Start with the total number of spoons",No
6000025_3,"TUTOR: Hi can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure! I started by letting x be the number of spoons that Julia bought. Then, I added 5 to x to get the total number of spoons. After that, I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons to get the number of spoons left after Julia sampled her stew. Finally, I set up an equation with the total number of spoons and the number of spoons left after sampling, and solved for x. This gave me the answer of 4, which is the number of spoons that Julia bought. TUTOR: OK, you started off correctly but there is an error in step 3. You should add the 3 spoons to the total, not subtract. Try it again",No
6000025_4,"TUTOR: hi can you talk me through your answer STUDENT: Sure. I started by assuming that the number of spoons Julia bought was ""x"". Then, I added 5 to that number to account for the spoons her husband bought. After that, I subtracted 3 from the total number of spoons, since Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. This gave me the equation x + 5 = 9. I then subtracted 5 from both sides of the equation to get x = 4, which means that Julia bought a package of 4 spoons. TUTOR: ok lets start at the beginning, how many spoons did julia have when she set the table",No
6000025_5,"TUTOR: Hi Cody, please have a look back at your answer and try again STUDENT: Okay, let's try again. 

Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought ""x"". 
Her husband bought 5 more spoons, so the total number of spoons is now x + 5. 
Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she had 12 spoons left. 
We know that the total number of spoons is x + 5, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 5 = 12

6000046_3,"TUTOR: Hi Stephanie, can you explain yuor method here, please? STUDENT: Sure. So first I figured out how many books Elise sold in the first year. I assumed that number to be x and then used the information that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year to calculate x. Then I subtracted the number of unsold books from the total number of books to get the total number of books sold in three years. Since we already know how many books were sold in the first year, I was able to calculate how many books were sold in the second and third year. Finally, I multiplied the number of books sold in the second year by the cost of each book to get the total amount of money earned in the second year. TUTOR: Wow, fantastic work!

6000067_2,"TUTOR: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. If 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, then 95% of the candles don't have that defect. So, out of 50000 candles, 95% of them won't smell like wet dog, which is 0.95 x 50000 = 47500 candles. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles. Therefore, there will be 475 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. TUTOR: That is a complete misunderstanding of the question. You have assumed that 5% of the total candles smell like wet dog. But the question mentions 5% of the defective candles smell like wet dog. Do you see your mistake?",No
6000067_3,"TUTOR: Hello Stephanie, can you walk me through your solution please? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of candles that don't smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have the defect, 95% of the candles don't have the defect. So, out of 50000 candles, 95% of them won't smell like wet dog, which is 0.95 x 50000 = 47500 candles. Then, I calculated the number of candles that will explode. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles. So, in total, there will be 475 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. TUTOR: Excellent, lets look at this step by step. We want to know how many are likely to explode. How do we find this out?",Yes
6000067_5,"TUTOR: Hi , could you please walk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure. I started by calculating the number of candles that don't smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, that means 95% of the candles don't have that defect. So, out of 50000 candles, 95% of them won't smell like wet dog, which is 0.95 x 50000 = 47500 candles.

Then, I calculated the number of candles that will explode. Out of the 47500 candles that don't smell like wet dog, 1% of them will still explode, which is 0.01 x 47500 = 475 candles.

Therefore, there will be 475 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. TUTOR: no you see, we need to find out the number the candles that smell like dog and also explodes, both. so 1% candles that explode should not be calculated on the candles that do not smell.",No
6000069_3,"TUTOR: Please talk me through your problem? STUDENT: Sure. I started by letting x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. Then, I realized that he kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them, which is 2/3x. He sold them for $1.5 each, so he earned 1.5(2/3x) = 3x/2 dollars. He wanted to end up with $50 spending cash, so he needed to earn $100 + $50 = $150 in total. Therefore, 3x/2 = $150. To solve for x, I divided both sides by 3/2, which gave me x = 100. So, Kenny started with 100 cards. TUTOR: First work out how much money he made selling the cards?",No
6000069_4,"TUTOR: X cannot be 100 if 2x is 150 would you like to try again STUDENT: Yes, I would like to try again. Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with. He kept 1/3 of them, so he sold 2/3 of them, which is 2/3x. He sold them for $1.5 each, so he earned 1.5(2/3x) = 3x/2 dollars. He wants to end up with $50 spending cash, so he needs to earn $100 + $50 = $150 in total. Therefore, 3x/2 = $150. Solving for x, we get x = 200. Kenny started with 200 cards. TUTOR: If I tell you the answer is 150 cards can you work to this figure",No
6000070_1,"TUTOR: Hi Winnie, please can you talk me through your solution? STUDENT: Sure, I started by figuring out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. He was told to prepare enough for 36 guests, but half of them were to have two hotdogs each. So, I calculated that he prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs. Then I realized that 40 guests showed up, so I subtracted 18 from 40 to get 22 guests who did not get a second hotdog. TUTOR: Okay, you've missed something out. If every guest had one hot dog how many would there be?",No
6000070_2,"TUTOR: Hi Alejandra, good work. Can you tell me about your approach to this problem? STUDENT: Hi, I started by figuring out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. I knew that he prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs each, so I multiplied 18 by 2 to get 36. Then I subtracted 18 from 40 to figure out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog. TUTOR: I think you're on the right track, but I see one small mistake at the beginning of your answer (I think the question was a bit unclear).  Let me ask you a silly question -- do you think it would be a very good party if only half the guests were able to eat?",No
6000070_3,"TUTOR: Hi Steven. Your answer to this question wasn't correct. Read it again carefully. The caterer prepared enough for half the guests to be able to have 2 hotdogs. This means the rest of the guests would be able to have 1 hotdog. How many hotdogs did he prepare in total? STUDENT: The caterer prepared enough for half the guests to have 2 hotdogs, which means he prepared 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs in total. TUTOR: That is not right. He prepared enough for all the guests to have ONE hotdog, how many is that?",No
6000070_4,"TUTOR: lakisha can you explain your answer stepwise. STUDENT: Sure. The caterer was told to prepare gourmet hotdogs for 36 guests, so he prepared enough for 18 guests to have two hotdogs each. That means he prepared a total of 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, so there were 40 - 18 = 22 guests who did not get a second hotdog. So the answer is 22. TUTOR: so 36 hotdogs were made considering 18 guests can have a second hotdog, am I right?",No
6000072_1,"TUTOR: Hi Brenda, you were asked for the perimeter of the room in feet. You made an error on the second line, can you spot what it is? STUDENT: Oh, I see. I should have multiplied the 3 yards by 3 feet instead of dividing it. The correct calculation should be:

perimeter = 2(length + width)
perimeter = 2(3 yards x 3 ft/yd + 120 ft)
perimeter = 2(9 ft + 120 ft)
perimeter = 2(129 ft)
perimeter = 258 ft TUTOR: You are right that you need to multiply the yards by 3 to get the number fo feet but there was an earlier step before that line that also needs updating. Can you try again?",No
6000072_4,"TUTOR: Hi Seth, good work. Tell me about your strategy here? TUTOR: Hi Seth, do you remember how many feet are in a yard? STUDENT: Yes, I remember that there are 3 feet in a yard. TUTOR: Great! So if the length of the room is 3 yards, what is the length in feet?",Yes
6000072_5,"TUTOR: DeAndre, can you walk me through your solution STUDENT: Sure. I started by using the area formula to find the width of the room. I knew the area was 360 sq ft and the length was 3 yards, so I divided 360 by 3 to get the width of the room, which was 120 ft. Then I used the perimeter formula to find the perimeter of the room. I added the length and width together and multiplied by 2 to get the perimeter, which was 258 ft. TUTOR: Can you rethink your strategy? Think about the length of the room only",No
